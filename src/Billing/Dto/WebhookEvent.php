/**
 * Parsed, verified webhook event returned by PaymentProvider::handleWebhook().
 *
 * By the time the driver returns this, the HMAC signature has been verified.
 * The route handler should dispatch on $type to update its domain model.
 *
 * Canonical event types (driver-normalised, NOT provider strings):
 *
 *   'payment.captured'       — payment fully captured; safe to activate subscription/fulfil order.
 *   'payment.failed'         — payment declined or timed out; mark as failed.
 *   'subscription.activated' — subscription created and active.
 *   'subscription.charged'   — renewal charge successful.
 *   'subscription.completed' — subscription ran to end of term.
 *   'subscription.cancelled' — subscription cancelled (effective at period end).
 *   'subscription.halted'    — subscription halted due to failed charges.
 *   'refund.created'         — refund initiated.
 *   'refund.processed'       — refund completed.
 *   'unknown'                — event type not covered above; inspect $raw.
 *
 * Beyond the provider-native $payload/$raw, settlement events (payment
 * captured / subscription charged) additionally carry a NORMALISED,
 * driver-populated projection ($invoiceRef/$gatewayTxnRef/
 * $amountMinorUnits/$currency/$capturedAt) so provider-agnostic glue (see
 * `StoneScriptPHP\Billing\CollectionOrchestrator`) can extract what it
 * needs without knowing each provider's native payload shape. These
 * fields are ADDITIVE and all nullable — existing consumers reading only
 * $payload/$raw are unaffected. A driver populates them only for event
 * types it can unambiguously map; they are null otherwise.

     * @param ?string $currency          Normalised: ISO 4217 currency code.
